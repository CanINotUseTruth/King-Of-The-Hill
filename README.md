## How to Play

* Use the commands below to give out the crown to one player or alternatively spawn it in with the /give command or creative mode.
* The crown gives extra hearts and the glowing effect to the King.
* Seekers can craft the crown locator and right-click it to find out the position of the King.
* When the King is killed the crown is automatically passed to the slayer of the King.
* The King will remain as King if they die from "natural causes" i.e. a non-player kill, this is to allow for strategic maneuvers.
* **Do not have multiple crowns active.** This won't break the game but will only show the closest king.
